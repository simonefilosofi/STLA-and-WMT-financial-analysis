- In the main text, you just discuss the data and all the info about your firms.
- Tables and figures, and all details of the computations go at the end of the document, you can have as many as you want in an separate appendix.

## Page 1: Summarize and introduce your firms
- In the first half page, assess, for each company, who runs the company, CEO, and a description of the company and the industry is in
- Second, check if there is something in the news (everything that has to do with your firm in the recent years)

Max one page, but it can be less. 

## Page 2-3
- Take the historical stock (5 years at least, monthly) and bond prices, apply different valuation methods to assess whether the stock price is fair. If bonds are not present, try to assess what would be the bond price in any case (looking at the firm ratings of similar firms), or check whether they have loans in the balance sheet and try to assess interest rate from the interest payments (interests/total bank debt)
- Take the last 5 years balance-sheets to assess the growth and other parameters of the firms, and then you compare your computation with the current stock price. For the return on equity, see below
- Compute the betas of the firms based on the last 5 years series of stock prices. You find stock prices on yahoo.finance. Discuss the risk according to your results.

## Page 3-4/5
- Form a portfolio with these firms and assess how the portfolio of your companies would be in terms of risk-return, compared to each single stock
- Assess the capital structure and the cost of capital of these companies
- Analyze the dividend policy of the firm, whether is a growth or value company
